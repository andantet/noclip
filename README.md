`noclip` is a mod that allows you to **clip through blocks like spectator mode.**
It can be activated through the **backtick key (\`)** by default!

The noclip mode:
- **makes block placement and movement easier**
- **allows you to place blocks where you are standing**
- **limits interaction with item entities, experience orbs, and spawners**

This mod also adds:
- **bedrock-like snappy flight**
- the ability to **adjust/reset your flight speed in any game mode**

### **All configurable!**
